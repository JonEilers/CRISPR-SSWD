# CRISPR-SSWD
Looking at CRISPR sequences in Metagenomic Datasets of Sea Stars affected by Sea Star Wasting Disease and Healthy Individuals

TO-DO
[]Read up on viral reference genomes or cogs
[] Read up on sea star wasting disease
[ ] Read up on finding CRISPR sequences in metagenomic data
[ ] Read up on sea star bacteria and biology
[ ] Find and install software for finding CRISPR sequences in metagenomic datasets
[ ] Trial run on one sick and one healthy dataset
[ ] Build reference tree
[ ] create flow chart of process
[ ] make power point slide for pitch
[ ] if initial test successful, apply for a grant. NSF?
[ ] Make list of what sort of tests and visualizations will be down. eg circo plot, ipath, cytoscape etc
